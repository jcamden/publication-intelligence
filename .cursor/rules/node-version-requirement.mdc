# Node.js Version Requirement

This project requires Node.js version 23. Before running any pnpm commands, you must activate the correct Node version using nvm.

## Required Setup

Always run `nvm use 23` before executing pnpm commands:

```bash
# ✅ GOOD - Activate Node 23 first
nvm use 23
pnpm install

# ✅ GOOD - Chain commands
nvm use 23 && pnpm add some-package

# ❌ BAD - Running pnpm without activating Node 23
pnpm install
```

## Why This Matters

- Ensures consistent Node.js version across development environments
- Prevents version-related dependency issues
- Required for proper package installation and script execution

## Reminder Pattern

When instructing the user to run pnpm commands, always include the nvm setup:

```
Please run:
nvm use 23
pnpm add package-name
```
