# Package Installation Policy

## Never install packages automatically

Always ask the user to install packages manually instead of running installation commands.

```bash
# ❌ BAD - Don't run these automatically
pnpm install
pnpm add some-package
npm install
yarn add some-package

# ✅ GOOD - Prompt the user instead
"Please run: pnpm add some-package"
```

## When dependencies are needed

If code changes require new dependencies:

1. **Identify the packages** needed
2. **Tell the user** which packages to install
3. **Provide the exact command** they should run
4. **Wait for confirmation** before proceeding

```
❌ BAD:
"I'll install the required packages now..."
[runs pnpm install]

✅ GOOD:
"This feature requires the `zod` package. Please run:
pnpm add zod

Let me know when it's installed and I'll continue."
```

## Why this matters

- Gives user control over dependency changes
- Allows review of package choices before installation
- Prevents unexpected changes to lock files
- User can verify package versions and licenses first
