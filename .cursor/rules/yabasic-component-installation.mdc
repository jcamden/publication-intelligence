# Adding Shadcn Components to Yabasic

## Base UI Components Required

The `yabasic` package uses **Base UI** (not Radix UI) for its component primitives. All components must be Base UI versions.

## Installation Command

When adding shadcn components to yabasic, always use the Base UI registry:

```bash
cd packages/yabasic && pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://basecn.dev/r/[component-name].json
```

### Examples

```bash
# Add tabs component
cd packages/yabasic && pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://basecn.dev/r/tabs.json

# Add dialog component  
cd packages/yabasic && pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://basecn.dev/r/dialog.json

# Add switch component
cd packages/yabasic && pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://basecn.dev/r/switch.json
```

## Why Base UI?

The `yabasic` package is configured with `"style": "base-nova"` in `components.json`, which uses Base UI primitives. All existing components import from `@base-ui/react/*`:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Base UI
import { Tabs as TabsPrimitive } from "@base-ui/react/tabs";
import { Select as SelectPrimitive } from "@base-ui/react/select";
import { Accordion as AccordionPrimitive } from "@base-ui/react/accordion";

// ❌ WRONG - Radix UI (don't use in yabasic)
import * as TabsPrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-tabs";
import * as SelectPrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-select";
```

## Installation Policy

Following the package installation policy, **always prompt the user** to run the installation command rather than executing it automatically:

```
❌ BAD:
"I'll add the tabs component now..."
[runs pnpm command]

✅ GOOD:
"To add the tabs component with Base UI, please run:
cd packages/yabasic && pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://basecn.dev/r/tabs.json"
```

## Verification

After installation, verify the component uses Base UI by checking the import:

```typescript
import { ComponentName as ComponentPrimitive } from "@base-ui/react/component-name";
```

If the component imports from `@radix-ui`, it was installed incorrectly and needs to be replaced with the Base UI version.
