# Documentation Policy

## Never create documentation files proactively

Do NOT create markdown files (.md) or other documentation files unless the user explicitly requests them.

```
❌ BAD - Creating docs without being asked:
- summary.md
- CHANGES.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md
- any-other-summary.md

✅ GOOD - Only create docs when explicitly requested:
User: "Create a summary of what we just built"
User: "Write a README for this feature"
User: "Document the API endpoints in a markdown file"
```

## Why this matters

- Generating unrequested documentation wastes tokens
- Users prefer clean commits without extra files
- Documentation should be intentional, not automatic

## When documentation IS appropriate

- User explicitly asks: "Create a README" or "Document this"
- Updating existing docs as part of a feature change
- Adding inline code comments for complex logic (not file summaries)
