# Economic Model

**Publication Intelligence / IndexPDF**

---

## 1) Executive Summary

IndexPDF is a niche SaaS product targeting authors, publishers, and professional indexers.

The economic model is characterized by:

* modest but real market size
* high willingness to pay among serious users
* low infrastructure costs (BYO API keys)
* high leverage for a solo developer
* slow but durable growth

Realistic long-term outcome:

* **Base case:** $200K–$800K ARR
* **Strong success:** $1.5M–$4M ARR
* **Exceptional niche dominance:** $5M–$12M ARR

This positions IndexPDF as a high-margin, defensible micro-platform rather than a unicorn startup.

## 2) Value Proposition → Pricing Logic

### 2.1 Who pays and why?

| User Type             | Core Value                   | Willingness to Pay |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Independent authors   | Save time & cost of indexing | $5–$30/month       |
| Academic editors      | Quality + speed              | $20–$100/month     |
| Professional indexers | Productivity boost           | $30–$200/month     |
| Publishers            | Workflow automation          | $100–$1,000+/month |

Key insight:

> IndexPDF saves *time and labor*, not just convenience.

Professional indexing costs:

* $3–$8 per page for book indexing (typical range).
* A 300-page book → $900–$2,400.

If IndexPDF reduces cost by even 50%, it creates massive perceived value.

## 3) Pricing Model Design

### 3.1 Core Principles

1. Simple enough to understand.
2. Scales with usage but doesn’t punish serious users.
3. Works with BYO API keys.
4. Encourages subscription, not one-off churn.

---

### 3.2 Recommended Pricing Model (Hybrid)

#### Tier 1 — Individual

* $9–$19/month
* PDF uploads up to X pages/month
* Basic indexing features
* BYO API keys
* Ideal for authors and students

#### Tier 2 — Pro

* $39–$79/month
* Higher limits
* Advanced concept extraction
* Multiple index types
* Export formats
* Priority processing

#### Tier 3 — Publisher / Team

* $149–$499/month
* Multiple users
* Shared projects
* Collaboration features
* Custom workflows

#### Optional Add-ons

* extra processing credits
* hosted LLM usage (if not BYO)
* large-document processing
* enterprise support

---

### 3.3 Why not per-entry pricing?

Per-entry pricing fails because:

* index quality ≠ number of entries
* discourages experimentation
* feels punitive
* hard to predict cost

Subscription pricing aligns better with creative workflows.

---

### 3.4 Why not purely usage-based pricing?

Usage pricing is good for infrastructure products, not creative tools.

Creative users want:

* predictable cost
* freedom to explore
* psychological safety

So:

> Subscription + soft usage limits > hard metering.

---

## 4) Cost Structure

### 4.1 Infrastructure Costs

Assuming BYO API keys:

| Cost Category | Monthly Cost (Early Stage) |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| Hosting (GCP) | $20–$150                   |
| Storage       | $5–$50                     |
| Queue / Redis | $10–$50                    |
| Monitoring    | $0–$50                     |
| Domain + misc | $5–$20                     |

Total baseline: **$40–$320/month**

LLM costs: mostly externalized to users.

---

### 4.2 Development Costs

As a solo developer:

* opportunity cost = my time
* direct cash cost = low

Estimate:

| Phase            | Time       | Effective Cost       |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| MVP              | 2–4 months | $0–$5K cash          |
| Beta + iteration | 3–6 months | $0–$10K cash         |
| Scaling          | ongoing    | $50–$300/month infra |

---

### 4.3 Support & Ops Costs

As user base grows:

| Users     | Support Load                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| <100      | negligible                         |
| 100–500   | manageable                         |
| 500–2,000 | meaningful                         |
| 2,000+    | requires tooling or part-time help |

But indexing users are typically low-support, high-skill.

## 5) Revenue Scenarios

### 5.1 Conservative Scenario (Likely)

Assumptions:

* 500 paying users
* average revenue per user (ARPU) = $20/month

Revenue:

* Monthly: $10,000
* Annual: $120,000 ARR

This is a very realistic outcome.

---

### 5.2 Strong Scenario (Success in niche)

Assumptions:

* 2,000 users
* ARPU = $35/month

Revenue:

* Monthly: $70,000
* Annual: $840,000 ARR

This puts us in “serious SaaS” territory.

---

### 5.3 Exceptional Scenario (Platform breakout)

Assumptions:

* 5,000 users
* ARPU = $50/month

Revenue:

* Monthly: $250,000
* Annual: $3M ARR

This requires:

* strong product-market fit
* community adoption
* institutional customers

Possible but not guaranteed.

---

## 6) Profitability Model

Because infrastructure costs are low:

Gross margin:

* 80–95%

Example:

At $840K ARR:

* Infra: $20K–$60K/year
* Tools, ops, misc: $50K/year
* Total costs: ~$100K/year

Profit:

* ~$740K/year (before taxes and my own salary).

This is why niche SaaS is powerful.

---

## 7) Growth Dynamics

### 7.1 Customer Acquisition

Likely channels:

* SEO (“PDF indexing”, “book index tool”)
* academic communities
* theology / publishing niches
* dev blog / thought leadership
* word of mouth

CAC (customer acquisition cost):

* likely very low ($5–$50)
* but growth is slow

---

### 7.2 Churn

Indexing tools have:

* low frequency usage
* high episodic usage
* seasonal churn

Mitigation:

* annual plans
* project-based workflows
* multi-format expansion

Expected churn:

* 3–8% monthly early
* 1–3% monthly later

---

## 8) Strategic Economic Insight

Here is the uncomfortable truth:

> IndexPDF will probably never be a unicorn.

But it can be:

* intellectually meaningful
* financially sustainable
* personally liberating
* strategically expandable

It’s a “deep tech niche SaaS,” not a VC rocket ship.

---

## 9) Founder Reality Model

Given:

* solo developer
* family responsibilities
* desire for autonomy
* technical depth

The most realistic path:

| Year   | ARR         |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Year 1 | $0–$30K     |
| Year 2 | $50K–$200K  |
| Year 3 | $200K–$800K |
| Year 5 | $500K–$3M   |
